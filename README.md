# UFOs

## Project Overview of the UFO Tracker
#### The goal of this project was to create a webpage using HTML and JavaScript that allows users to search for UFO sightings based on multiple search criteria.

#### Resources
- Data Source:  static/js/data.js
- Software:  Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- Languages:  JavaScript, HTML

## Results of the Webpage
By following the steps listed below a user can enter the search criteria for UFO sightings.  

1.  The search parameters must be typed according to the examples in the placeholder fields of the `Filter Search` box.

2.  Begin by typing in the date according to the example.  The date of `1/1/2010` was used in the example.  Because all the sightings in the `data.js` file are located in the United States, "us" was also entered as the default search country.

3.  Next, type in the state according to the example.  California was used in the example by typing in `ca`.

## Summary
By creating multiple filter options for the search, the data set can be quickly filtered to the user's desired parameters.  Although this is can be helpful, one drawback to the webpage is that the search criteria need to be typed exactly as they are captured in the `data.js` file that is being filtered.  Results could easily be overlooked if the search isn't conducted according to the examples shown in the placeholder fields in the Filter Box.
